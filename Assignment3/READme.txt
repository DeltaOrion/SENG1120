I HAVE attempted the BONUS question as marked by the bonus.txt 

Instructions: 
  - Unzip all contents into a single folder
  - open cygwin and navigate to the folder
  - Compile on cygwin terminal using the make command 'make' with the g++ compilier 

Note that the BONUS TASK WAS ATTEMPTED and thus the hashtable has 300 slots instead of 5000 as specified in the brief and because of this
the output should be different to the specified output.
