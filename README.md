# SENG1120
University of Newcastle - Data Structures - 2021

SENG1120 or Data Structures is a course in the University of Newcastle that focuses on the internal structure, function, purpose and applications of data structures as well as important object oriented design principles such as encapsulation, inheritance and abstraction. The course looks at the LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Heap, HashTable, BST and PriorityQueue. All assignments are coded in c++. 

## Structure

- A1: A simple implementation of a LinkedList with a hard-coded data type. 
- A2: An extension of the 1st assignment to use a generic LinkedList and use the data structure for a Stack. 
- A3: Comparison of a HashTable to a Binary Search tree for a simple inventory management program.

## Building

All assignments should be built with the GNU C++ tested on Cygwin. One can build each assignment as follows

```sh
make clean
rm -rf *.o core
 ```

The output should be assignment\<x\>.exe and can be executed as follows

```sh
./assignment<x>.exe
```

NOTE - **Additional build instructions might be found in the individual assignments `README.txt` folder**
