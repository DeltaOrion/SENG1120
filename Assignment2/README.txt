I HAVE attempted the BONUS question as marked by the bonus.txt 

Instructions: 
  - Unzip all contents into a single folder
  - open cygwin and navigate to the folder
  - Compile on cygwin terminal using the make command 'make' with the g++ compilier 

Note that the BONUS TASK WAS ATTEMPTED and thus Lstack only contains methods relevant to generic stacks as instructed in the assignment brief.
